# Getting started with JAVA

Every line of code running in java must be inside a class.

JAVA is a case-sensitive and follows pure OOP structure.

In JAVA the class name should always begin with uppercase.

In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.

Like C/C++ java also supports single line and multiline comments.
